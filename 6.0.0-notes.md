1. removed RUM artifacts
2. removed Profiles
3. moved sampling decision from Event constructor to function calling Span constructor.
4. changed API signature of Span
   - 3rd argument is settings object, not xtrace/parent
   - 3rd argument must contain {inbound, doSample}
   - 3rd argument optional {metadata}
   - inbound (boolean) the span is a top level span as the result of an inbound request. it will either start a trace or continue one from an external source.
   - doSample (boolean) sample this trace or not.
5. changed API signature of Event
   - 3rd argument is metadata to use for the event creation.
   - 4th argument is whether to edge back to the metadata or not. (might be able to avoid this).
6. stringToMetadata() consider error if opID is all zeros (call lower level bindings fn to avoid)
   - takes check out of probes/http.js
