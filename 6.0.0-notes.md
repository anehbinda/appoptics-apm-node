1. removed RUM artifacts
2. removed Profiles
3. moved sampling decision from Event constructor to function calling Span constructor.
4. [API BREAKING] changed API signature of Span
    - 3rd argument is settings object, not xtrace/parent
    - 3rd argument required {inbound, doSample}
    - 3rd argument optional {metadata}
    - inbound (boolean) the span is a top level span as the result of an inbound request. it will either start a trace or continue one from an external source.
    - doSample (boolean) sample this trace or not.
5. [API BREAKING] changed API signature of Event
    - 3rd argument is metadata to use for the event creation.
    - 4th argument is whether to edge back to the metadata or not. (might be able to avoid this).
6. stringToMetadata() consider error if opID is all zeros (call lower level bindings fn to avoid)
    - takes check out of probes/http.js
7. packages with probe naming considerations (and their tests)
    - director
    - express
    - koa-resource-router
    - koa-route
    - koa-router
    - restify
8. moved KV pairs out of event and into event.kv https://chromium.googlesource.com/external/github.com/v8/v8.wiki/+/60dc23b22b18adc6a8902bd9693e386a3748040a/Design-Elements.md
9. stubbed new function bindings.Context.getTraceSetting() for use by entry/root spans.
10. added XgetTraceSettings() to appoptics-bindings/napi-branch. will become replacement for all entry/root spans.
11. [API BREAKING] change signature of span builder function in startOrContinueTrace, instrument, runInstrument, instrumentHttp. This impacts many tests.
12. move all decision/metadata generation logic into bindings.Context.getTraceSettings(). (this is implemented in index.js until there is a production tested oboe ready to go with the API in it. when that's ready the code will start using the oboe facility and the javascript implementation can be removed.)
13. modified span builder function return value's finalize function: spanInfo.finalize(span, previousSpan)
14. allow clearing of messages to be checked when testing.
15. don't store KV pairs if not sampling
16. fix koa-router probe bugs, add tests
17. make APPOPTICS_LOG_SETTING variable work in preference to DEBUG; clean up log levels. use `debug-custom` package.
18. warn if not loaded first (if production)
19. fix wrong oboe version reported
20. fix existsSync tests for node > 10.15.0 (again, thanks node)
21. warn if disabled by config
22. make noop custom tests work again
23. don't send init message when disabled
24. don't enable patching when disabled
25. move addon skeleton to addon-essentials.js

Changelog
- fix koa-router probe to work with multiple middleware arguments
- use APPOPTICS_LOG_SETTINGS to set log levels; using the DEBUG environment variable is deprecated
- issue explicit log warning if disabled by config
- formerly invisible route handling code and middleware show up as spans
- break high-level API change
    - there is no longer a span builder function; it has been replaced by a span info function.
    - the span info function returns an object {name: span-name, kvpairs: object, finalize: function}
    - only span name is required but there is no need to use a span-info function for the name alone
    - finalize is a function. it's called with the span that was created using span-info. finalize is used by probes.
- breaking low-level API changes
    - Span constructor signature has changed
        - 3rd argument is settings object, previously was xtrace/parent
        - settings required properties: inbound, doSample
            - inbound (boolean) - this is a top level span
            - doSample (boolean) - this trace should be sampled
        - settings optional properties: metadata, doMetrics
    - Event constructor signature has changed
        - 3rd argument (required metadata) parent metadata for event (uses task ID and sample bit)
        - 4th argument (optional boolean) edge back to parent.
- bindings breaking changes
    - there are many. if you're using code at that level let us know and we'll write them up.
-

in progress
    - change this into first changelog

pending
    - consider bindings.event.addInfo() => addKVpair()

in the grinder
    - consider removing traces completely when not sampling or doing metrics. (not so simple have to propagate xtrace on outbound requests and that requires cls bindings and binding emitters for various packages)
    - use emitter.prepend instead of event-pre-handler (not clear it's a drop-in functional replacement)
    - consider MakeEntrySpan class extends Span?
