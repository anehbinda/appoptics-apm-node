1. removed RUM artifacts
2. removed Profiles
3. moved sampling decision from Event constructor to function calling Span constructor.
4. [API BREAKING] changed API signature of Span
   - 3rd argument is settings object, not xtrace/parent
   - 3rd argument must contain {inbound, doSample}
   - 3rd argument optional {metadata}
   - inbound (boolean) the span is a top level span as the result of an inbound request. it will either start a trace or continue one from an external source.
   - doSample (boolean) sample this trace or not.
5. [API BREAKING] changed API signature of Event
   - 3rd argument is metadata to use for the event creation.
   - 4th argument is whether to edge back to the metadata or not. (might be able to avoid this).
6. stringToMetadata() consider error if opID is all zeros (call lower level bindings fn to avoid)
   - takes check out of probes/http.js
7. packages with probe naming considerations (and their tests)
    - director
    - express
    - koa-resource-router
    - koa-route
    - koa-router
    - restify
8. moved KV pairs out of event and into event.kv https://developers.google.com/v8/design#fast-property-access
9. stubbed new function bindings.Context.getTraceSetting() for use by entry/root spans.
10. added XgetTraceSettings() to appoptics-bindings/napi-branch. will become replacement for all entry/root spans.
11. [API BREAKING] change signature of span builder function in startOrContinueTrace, instrument, runInstrument, instrumentHttp.

in progress
- move all decision/metadata generation logic into bindings.Context.getTraceSettings().
- doc updates
- cleanup

pending
- determine whether args always need to be passed or defaults are safe (referring to Event() args)
- consider bindings.event.addInfo() => addKVpair()
- Span.prototype.descend is not really an instance method; it descends from Event.last, not the instance. Issue (mismatched ids?)
- double check 'fs' code where picking up fd/path depends on 'last'

in the grinder
- consider removing traces completely when not sampling or doing metrics. (not so simple have to propagate xtrace on outbound requests)
- use emitter.prepend instead of event-pre-handler (not clear it's a drop-in functional replacement)
